I created a boxing website, the website was mainly about the quallity of the products
# cart
the cart was the esiest page to make, i just had to adjust some things and it was readyto go
# shoping 
i had to go to multiple sites to get the images that were used,it was missing some css at first was later fixed 
# signup
the singup page was fun to make, it was really cool to see how our sites were being created
